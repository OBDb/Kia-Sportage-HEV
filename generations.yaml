    description: "The Kia Sportage Hybrid (HEV) was introduced as part of the fifth-generation Sportage lineup, marking Kia's first hybrid offering in this popular compact crossover segment. Powered by a 1.6-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine paired with an electric motor and a 1.49 kWh battery pack, the system produces a combined 227 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. This powertrain is coupled with a six-speed automatic transmission rather than the CVT often used in hybrid vehicles, delivering a more conventional driving experience. Available in both front-wheel and all-wheel drive configurations, the Sportage Hybrid achieves impressive fuel economy ratings of up to 43 mpg city for the FWD version. The HEV model features the same bold exterior design as the standard fifth-generation Sportage, with its distinctive boomerang-shaped LED daytime running lights and tiger-nose grille, while sharing the high-tech interior that includes dual 12.3-inch screens in higher trims. The Sportage Hybrid offers slightly improved acceleration compared to the standard model while maintaining all of its practicality, including generous passenger space and cargo capacity. As Kia's approach to electrification, the Sportage HEV bridges the gap between conventional internal combustion engines and fully electric vehicles, providing an efficient option for buyers not yet ready to commit to plug-in technology."
